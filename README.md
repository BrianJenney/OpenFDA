Simple AJAX request to OpenFDA, an API which has information from the Food and Drug Administration. Pretty neat! I have provided my key but they're super easy to get... so get one too!

Goto:   https://open.fda.gov/   --to get your keys, look at documentation, etc.

I'm hoping you will pull this, maybe add some style or if-else statements and whatever you want to make this a much more functional and valuable application. 

I chose to use OpenFDA because I have not seen a lot of examples on Github or otherwise making use of this really simple and useful API. 

Shabam!
